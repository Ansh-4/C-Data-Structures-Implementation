# C-Data-Structures-Implementation
Fundamental data structures in C, focusing on memory management concepts behind Python data structures.

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains clean and well-structured implementations of core data structures using the C programming language.  
The primary goal of this project is to build strong computer science fundamentals by working close to memory and understanding how data structures are implemented at a low level.

## 🎯 Motivation (C ↔ Python Connection)
While Python provides powerful built-in data structures like lists, stacks, and dictionaries, their internal behavior is abstracted away.

This repository bridges that gap by implementing the same concepts in **C**, helping to:
- Understand how Python data structures work internally
- Improve problem-solving and algorithmic thinking
- Gain confidence with pointers, memory allocation, and performance trade-offs

A strong grasp of C-based data structures directly improves efficiency and clarity when coding in Python and other high-level languages.
